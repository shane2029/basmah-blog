        <p>The Museo ni Manuel Quezon. The mausoleum of President Quezon and his wife, Aurora Aragon, is located on the equilateral triangular base of the shrine, which was designed by Federico Illustre. Three 66-meter-tall pylons, which symbolize Quezon's age at the time of his death and the three main Philippine islands, rise above the base. Italian artist Francesco Riccardo Monti created Art Deco statues of three angels holding sampaguita burial wreaths over the pylons.
